"""
This is a fake, empty app that exists so that we can use the Django
test runner to test the django_errordite logging handler.

It doesn't do anything, but does include the tests.

You can run the tests using the django test runner:

    $ ERRORDITE_TOKEN=your_token python manage.py test test_app

NB in order for this to run you will need django installed.
